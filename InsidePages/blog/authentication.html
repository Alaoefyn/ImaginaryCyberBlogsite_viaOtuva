          Conceptually at least, authentication vulnerabilities are some of the
          simplest issues to understand. However, they can be among the most
          critical due to the obvious relationship between authentication and
          security. As well as potentially allowing attackers direct access to
          sensitive data and functionality, they also expose additional attack
          surface for further exploits. For this reason, learning how to
          identify and exploit authentication vulnerabilities, including how to
          bypass common protection measures, is a fundamental skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, we'll look at some of the most common authentication
          mechanisms used by websites and discuss potential vulnerabilities in
          them. We'll highlight both inherent vulnerabilities in different
          authentication mechanisms, as well as some typical vulnerabilities
          that are introduced by their improper implementation. Finally, we'll
          provide some basic guidance on how you can ensure that your own
          authentication mechanisms are as robust as possible.

        <h2 id="what-is-authentication">What is authentication?</h2>
        <p>
          Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a given
          user or client. In other words, it involves making sure that they
          really are who they claim to be. At least in part, websites are
          exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet by design.
          Therefore, robust authentication mechanisms are an integral aspect of
          effective web security.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three authentication factors into which different types of
          authentication can be categorized:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Something you <strong>know</strong>, such as a password or the
            answer to a security question. These are sometimes referred to as
            "knowledge factors".
          </li>
          <li>
            Something you <strong>have</strong>, that is, a physical object like
            a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes referred to as
            "possession factors".
          </li>
          <li>
            Something you <strong>are</strong> or do, for example, your
            biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes referred to
            as "inherence factors".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Authentication mechanisms rely on a range of technologies to verify
          one or more of these factors.
        </p>
        <h2
          id="what-is-the-difference-between-authentication-and-authorization"
        >
          What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Authentication is the process of verifying that a user really
          <strong>is who they claim to be</strong>, whereas authorization
          involves verifying whether a user
          <strong>is allowed to do something</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of a website or web application, authentication
          determines whether someone attempting to access the site with the
          username
          <code>Carlos123</code> really is the same person who created the
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once <code>Carlos123</code> is authenticated, his permissions
          determine whether or not he is authorized, for example, to access
          personal information about other users or perform actions such as
          deleting another user's account.
        </p>
        <h2 id="how-do-authentication-vulnerabilities-arise">
          How do authentication vulnerabilities arise?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Broadly speaking, most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms
          arise in one of two ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to
            adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the
            authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker.
            This is sometimes referred to as "broken authentication".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In many areas of web development, logic flaws will simply cause the
          website to behave unexpectedly, which may or may not be a security
          issue. However, as authentication is so critical to security, the
          likelihood that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to
          security issues is clearly elevated.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-is-the-impact-of-vulnerable-authentication">
          What is the impact of vulnerable authentication?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The impact of authentication vulnerabilities can be very severe. Once
          an attacker has either bypassed authentication or has brute-forced
          their way into another user's account, they have access to all the
          data and functionality that the compromised account has. If they are
          able to compromise a high-privileged account, such as a system
          administrator, they could take full control over the entire
          application and potentially gain access to internal infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even compromising a low-privileged account might still grant an
          attacker access to data that they otherwise shouldn't have, such as
          commercially sensitive business information. Even if the account does
          not have access to any sensitive data, it might still allow the
          attacker to access additional pages, which provide a further attack
          surface. Often, certain high-severity attacks will not be possible
          from publicly accessible pages, but they may be possible from an
          internal page.
