          In this section, we'll introduce the concept of business logic vulnerabilities
          and explain how they can arise due to flawed assumptions about user behavior.
          We'll discuss the potential impact of logic flaws and teach you how they can
          be exploited. You can also practice what you've learned using our interactive
          labs, which are based on real bugs that we've encountered in the wild.
          Finally, we'll provide some general best practices to help you prevent these
          kinds of logic flaws arising in your own applications.

        <p>
          Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of
          an application that allow an attacker to elicit unintended behavior. This
          potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to
          achieve a malicious goal. These flaws are generally the result of failing to
          anticipate unusual application states that may occur and, consequently,
          failing to handle them safely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logic flaws are often invisible to people who aren't explicitly looking for
          them as they typically won't be exposed by normal use of the application.
          However, an attacker may be able to exploit behavioral quirks by interacting
          with the application in ways that developers never intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main purposes of business logic is to enforce the rules and
          constraints that were defined when designing the application or functionality.
          Broadly speaking, the business rules dictate how the application should react
          when a given scenario occurs. This includes preventing users from doing things
          that will have a negative impact on the business or that simply don't make
          sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flaws in the logic can allow attackers to circumvent these rules. For example,
          they might be able to complete a transaction without going through the
          intended purchase workflow. In other cases, broken or non-existent validation
          of user-supplied data might allow users to make arbitrary changes to
          transaction-critical values or submit nonsensical input. By passing unexpected
          values into server-side logic, an attacker can potentially induce the
          application to do something that it isn't supposed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logic-based vulnerabilities can be extremely diverse and are often unique to
          the application and its specific functionality. Identifying them often
          requires a certain amount of human knowledge, such as an understanding of the
          business domain or what goals an attacker might have in a given context. This
          makes them difficult to detect using automated vulnerability scanners. As a
          result, logic flaws are a great target for bug bounty hunters and manual
          testers in general.
        </p>
        
        <a
          id="how-do-business-logic-vulnerabilities-arise"
          href="#how-do-business-logic-vulnerabilities-arise"
          ><h2>How do business logic vulnerabilities arise?</h2></a
        >
        <p>
          Business logic vulnerabilities often arise because the design and development
          teams make flawed assumptions about how users will interact with the
          application. These bad assumptions can lead to inadequate validation of user
          input. For example, if the developers assume that users will pass data
          exclusively via a web browser, the application may rely entirely on weak
          client-side controls to validate input. These are easily bypassed by an
          attacker using an intercepting proxy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, this means that when an attacker deviates from the expected user
          behavior, the application fails to take appropriate steps to prevent this and,
          subsequently, fails to handle the situation safely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logic flaws are particularly common in overly complicated systems that even
          the development team themselves do not fully understand. To avoid logic flaws,
          developers need to understand the application as a whole. This includes being
          aware of how different functions can be combined in unexpected ways.
          Developers working on large code bases may not have an intimate understanding
          of how all areas of the application work. Someone working on one component
          could make flawed assumptions about how another component works and, as a
          result, inadvertently introduce serious logic flaws. If the developers do not
          explicitly document any assumptions that are being made, it is easy for these
          kinds of vulnerabilities to creep into an application.
        </p>
        
        <a
          id="what-is-the-impact-of-business-logic-vulnerabilities"
          href="#what-is-the-impact-of-business-logic-vulnerabilities"
          ><h2>What is the impact of business logic vulnerabilities?</h2></a
        >
        <p>
          The impact of business logic vulnerabilities can, at times, be fairly trivial.
          It is a broad category and the impact is highly variable. However, any
          unintended behavior can potentially lead to high-severity attacks if an
          attacker is able to manipulate the application in the right way. For this
          reason, quirky logic should ideally be fixed even if you can't work out how to
          exploit it yourself. There is always a risk that someone else will be able to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fundamentally, the impact of any logic flaw depends on what functionality it
          is related to. If the flaw is in the authentication mechanism, for example,
          this could have a serious impact on your overall security. Attackers could
          potentially exploit this for privilege escalation, or to bypass authentication
          entirely, gaining access to sensitive data and functionality. This also
          exposes an increased attack surface for other exploits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flawed logic in financial transactions can obviously lead to massive losses
          for the business through stolen funds, fraud, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should also note that even though logic flaws may not allow an attacker to
          benefit directly, they could still allow a malicious party to damage the
          business in some way.

          The best way to understand business logic vulnerabilities is to look at
          real-world cases and learn from the mistakes that were made. We've provided
          concrete examples of a variety of common logic flaws, as well as some
          deliberately vulnerable websites so that you can practice exploiting these
          vulnerabilities yourself.

          href="#how-to-prevent-business-logic-vulnerabilities"
          ><h2>How to prevent business logic vulnerabilities</h2></a
        >
        <p>In short, the keys to preventing business logic vulnerabilities are to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure developers and testers understand the domain that the application
            serves
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid making implicit assumptions about user behavior or the behavior of
            other parts of the application
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You should identify what assumptions you have made about the server-side state
          and implement the necessary logic to verify that these assumptions are met.
          This includes making sure that the value of any input is sensible before
          proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important to make sure that both developers and testers are able to
          fully understand these assumptions and how the application is supposed to
          react in different scenarios. This can help the team to spot logic flaws as
          early as possible. To facilitate this, the development team should adhere to
          the following best practices wherever possible:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Maintain clear design documents and data flows for all transactions and
            workflows, noting any assumptions that are made at each stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write code as clearly as possible. If it's difficult to understand what is
            supposed to happen, it will be difficult to spot any logic flaws. Ideally,
            well-written code shouldn't need documentation to understand it. In
            unavoidably complex cases, producing clear documentation is crucial to
            ensure that other developers and testers know what assumptions are being
            made and exactly what the expected behavior is.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note any references to other code that uses each component. Think about any
            side-effects of these dependencies if a malicious party were to manipulate
            them in an unusual way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Due to the relatively unique nature of many logic flaws, it is easy to brush
          them off as a one-time mistake due to human error and move on. However, as
          we've demonstrated, these flaws are often the result of bad practices in the
          initial phases of building the application. Analyzing why a logic flaw existed
          in the first place, and how it was missed by the team, can help you to spot
          weaknesses in your processes. By making minor adjustments, you can increase
          the likelihood that similar flaws will be cut off at the source or caught
          earlier in the development process.
