          common examples, explain how to find and exploit various kinds of SQL

        <p>
          SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker
          to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its
          database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are
          not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to
          other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to
          access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data,
          causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack
          to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure,
          or perform a denial-of-service attack.
        </p>

          ><h2>What is the impact of a successful SQL injection attack?</h2></a
        >
        <p>
          A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to
          sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal
          user information. Many high-profile data breaches in recent years have
          been the result of SQL injection attacks, leading to reputational
          damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a
          persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a
          long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period.

        <p>
          There are a wide variety of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks,
          and techniques, which arise in different situations. Some common SQL
          injection examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Retrieving hidden data, where you can modify an SQL query to return
            additional results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Subverting application logic, where you can change a query to
            interfere with the application's logic.
          </li>
          <li>
            UNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database
            tables.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examining the database, where you can extract information about the
            version and structure of the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are
            not returned in the application's responses.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Consider a shopping application that displays products in different
          categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser
          requests the URL:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts</code
        >
        <p>
          This causes the application to make an SQL query to retrieve details
          of the relevant products from the database:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1</code
        >
        <p>This SQL query asks the database to return:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>all details (*)</li>
          <li>from the products table</li>
          <li>where the category is Gifts</li>
          <li>and released is 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The restriction <code>released = 1</code> is being used to hide
          products that are not released. For unreleased products, presumably
          <code>released = 0</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection
          attacks, so an attacker can construct an attack like:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--</code
        >
        <p>This results in the SQL query:</p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1</code
        >
        <p>
          The key thing here is that the double-dash sequence <code>--</code> is
          a comment indicator in SQL, and means that the rest of the query is
          interpreted as a comment. This effectively removes the remainder of
          the query, so it no longer includes <code>AND released = 1</code>.
          This means that all products are displayed, including unreleased
          products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going further, an attacker can cause the application to display all
          the products in any category, including categories that they don't
          know about:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--</code
        >
        <p>This results in the SQL query:</p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1</code
        >
        <p>
          The modified query will return all items where either the category is
          Gifts, or 1 is equal to 1. Since
          <code>1=1</code> is always true, the query will return all items.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider an application that lets users log in with a username and
          password. If a user submits the username
          <code>wiener</code> and the password <code>bluecheese</code>, the
          application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL
          query:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'</code
        >
        <p>
          If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is
          successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, an attacker can log in as any user without a password simply by
          using the SQL comment sequence <code>--</code> to remove the password
          check from the <code>WHERE</code> clause of the query. For example,
          submitting the username <code>administrator'--</code> and a blank
          password results in the following query:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''</code
        >
        <p>
          This query returns the user whose username is
          <code>administrator</code> and successfully logs the attacker in as
          that user.
        </p>

        <a
          id="retrieving-data-from-other-database-tables"
          href="#retrieving-data-from-other-database-tables"
          ><h2>Retrieving data from other database tables</h2></a
        >
        <p>
          In cases where the results of an SQL query are returned within the
          application's responses, an attacker can leverage an SQL injection
          vulnerability to retrieve data from other tables within the database.
          This is done using the
          <code>UNION</code> keyword, which lets you execute an additional
          <code>SELECT</code> query and append the results to the original
          query.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if an application executes the following query containing
          the user input "Gifts":
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'</code
        >
        <p>then an attacker can submit the input:</p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--</code
        >
        <p>
          This will cause the application to return all usernames and passwords
          along with the names and descriptions of products.
        </p>

        <a id="examining-the-database" href="#examining-the-database"
          ><h2>Examining the database</h2></a
        >
        <p>
          Following initial identification of an SQL injection vulnerability, it
          is generally useful to obtain some information about the database
          itself. This information can often pave the way for further
          exploitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can query the version details for the database. The way that this
          is done depends on the database type, so you can infer the database
          type from whichever technique works. For example, on Oracle you can
          execute:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">SELECT * FROM v$version</code>
        <p>
          You can also determine what database tables exist, and which columns
          they contain. For example, on most databases you can execute the
          following query to list the tables:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables</code>

        <a
          id="blind-sql-injection-vulnerabilities"
          href="#blind-sql-injection-vulnerabilities"
          ><h2>Blind SQL injection vulnerabilities</h2></a
        >
        <p>
          Many instances of SQL injection are blind vulnerabilities. This means
          that the application does not return the results of the SQL query or
          the details of any database errors within its responses. Blind
          vulnerabilities can still be exploited to access unauthorized data,
          but the techniques involved are generally more complicated and
          difficult to perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the database
          involved, the following techniques can be used to exploit blind SQL
          injection vulnerabilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can change the logic of the query to trigger a detectable
            difference in the application's response depending on the truth of a
            single condition. This might involve injecting a new condition into
            some Boolean logic, or conditionally triggering an error such as a
            divide-by-zero.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can conditionally trigger a time delay in the processing of the
            query, allowing you to infer the truth of the condition based on the
            time that the application takes to respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can trigger an out-of-band network interaction, using OAST
            techniques. This technique is extremely powerful and works in
            situations where the other techniques do not. Often, you can
            directly exfiltrate data via the out-of-band channel, for example by
            placing the data into a DNS lookup for a domain that you control.
          </li>

          SQL injection can be detected manually by using a systematic set of
          tests against every entry point in the application. This typically
          involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Submitting the single quote character <code>'</code> and looking for
            errors or other anomalies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submitting some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base
            (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and
            looking for systematic differences in the resulting application
            responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submitting Boolean conditions such as <code>OR 1=1</code> and
            <code>OR 1=2</code>, and looking for differences in the
            application's responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submitting payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed
            within an SQL query, and looking for differences in the time taken
            to respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submitting OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network
            interaction when executed within an SQL query, and monitoring for
            any resulting interactions.

          Most SQL injection vulnerabilities arise within the
          <code>WHERE</code> clause of a <code>SELECT</code> query. This type of
          SQL injection is generally well-understood by experienced testers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But SQL injection vulnerabilities can in principle occur at any
          location within the query, and within different query types. The most
          common other locations where SQL injection arises are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <code>UPDATE</code> statements, within the updated values or the
            <code>WHERE</code> clause.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <code>INSERT</code> statements, within the inserted values.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <code>SELECT</code> statements, within the table or column name.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <code>SELECT</code> statements, within the
            <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          First-order SQL injection arises where the application takes user
          input from an HTTP request and, in the course of processing that
          request, incorporates the input into an SQL query in an unsafe way.
        </p>
        <p>
          In second-order SQL injection (also known as stored SQL injection),
          the application takes user input from an HTTP request and stores it
          for future use. This is usually done by placing the input into a
          database, but no vulnerability arises at the point where the data is
          stored. Later, when handling a different HTTP request, the application
          retrieves the stored data and incorporates it into an SQL query in an
          unsafe way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second-order SQL injection often arises in situations where developers
          are aware of SQL injection vulnerabilities, and so safely handle the
          initial placement of the input into the database. When the data is
          later processed, it is deemed to be safe, since it was previously
          placed into the database safely. At this point, the data is handled in
          an unsafe way, because the developer wrongly deems it to be trusted.

        <p>
          Some core features of the SQL language are implemented in the same way
          across popular database platforms, and so many ways of detecting and
          exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities work identically on different
          types of database.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are also many differences between common databases.
          These mean that some techniques for detecting and exploiting SQL
          injection work differently on different platforms. For example:

          ><h2>How to prevent SQL injection</h2></a
        >
        <p>
          Most instances of SQL injection can be prevented by using
          parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) instead of
          string concatenation within the query.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user
          input is concatenated directly into the query:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '"+ input +
          "'"; Statement statement = connection.createStatement(); ResultSet
          resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);</code
        >
        <p>
          This code can be easily rewritten in a way that prevents the user
          input from interfering with the query structure:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"
          >PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT *
          FROM products WHERE category = ?"); statement.setString(1, input);
          ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();</code
        >
        <p>
          Parameterized queries can be used for any situation where untrusted
          input appears as data within the query, including the
          <code>WHERE</code> clause and values in an <code>INSERT</code> or
          <code>UPDATE</code> statement. They can't be used to handle untrusted
          input in other parts of the query, such as table or column names, or
          the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause. Application functionality that
          places untrusted data into those parts of the query will need to take
          a different approach, such as white-listing permitted input values, or
          using different logic to deliver the required behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a parameterized query to be effective in preventing SQL injection,
          the string that is used in the query must always be a hard-coded
          constant, and must never contain any variable data from any origin. Do
          not be tempted to decide case-by-case whether an item of data is
          trusted, and continue using string concatenation within the query for
          cases that are considered safe. It is all too easy to make mistakes
          about the possible origin of data, or for changes in other code to
          violate assumptions about what data is tainted.
